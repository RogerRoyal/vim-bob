Workflow                                         *vim-bob-workflow*

The usual workflow is as follows:
* Change directory into the recipe repository.
* Start vim.
* Run |:BobInit| to initialize vim-bob.
* Run |:BobProject| to define the project to work on. This will build the
  current state of the project and setup configuration for the YouCompleteMe
  plugin.
* Use |:BobGoto| to set the working path to the root directory of the
  specified package.
* Start editing files of that package.
* Run |:make| to rebuild the project.

|:BobProject| automatically prevents writing to files in `dev/build/` and
`dev/dist`, because these files will be overwritten by Bob during a build and
it is easy to confuse them with equally named files in `dev/src/`. For example
build error messages could refer to header files of depending modules and
therefore jumping to the error jumps into `dev/dist/`. Rebuilding the project
after fixing an error in such a file would then overwrite the file and all
changes would be lost.
However, there is currently no way to remove this behaviour via vim-bobs API.
If necessary, this behaviour can be removed manually by deleting |augroup|
`bob` via `:augroup! bob` .

Commands                                         *vim-bob-commands*

                                                 *vim-bob:BobInit*
:BobInit
         Must be run before any other vim-bob command can be used. Initializes
         vim-bob with the current working directory as the base directory.
         The base directory is the directory where the bob commands are
         normally executed on the command line.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobCheckout*
:BobCheckout [package]
         Checkout the given [package].
         Runs "bob dev [package] --checkout-only".

                                                 *vim-bob:BobGoto*
:BobGoto [package]
         Changes the current working directory of the buffer to be the source
         directory of the given [package].
         Provided for auto-completion:
         * dependencies of current project exclusively
         * non-root recipes

:BobGoto! [package]
          Like ":BobGoto" but sets the current working directory globally.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobGotoAll*
:BobGotoAll [package]
         Changes the current working directory of the buffer to be the source
         directory of the given [package].
         Provides all available root recipes for auto-completion.

:BobGotoAll! [package]
          Like ":BobGotoAll" but sets the current working directory globally.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobDev*
:BobDev ([package] ([configuration] ([parameters])))
         Build [package] with [configuration] in development mode.
         Runs "bob dev [package] -c <configuration-dir>/[configuration]
         [parameters]"
         When called with no arguments the package, configuration and
         parameters are built that were specified with the last call of
         |:BobProject|.
         Additionally sets |makeprg| for the current file, so that
         subsequently the same command can be run via |:make| and error
         messages are parsed and gathered in the |quickfix| window.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobProject*
:BobProject [package] ([configuration] ([parameters]))
         Same as |BobDev| but additionally sets the current project to that
         package. That means that |:BobGoto| will provide only dependencies of
         that package for auto-completion, but opposing to |:BobGotoAll| it
         will also provide non-root recipes.
         Additionaly a ".ycm_extra_conf.py" file is generated that loads the
         compilation database from the build.  This allows conveniently using
         |YouCompleteMe| in a Bob environment.  It is necessary to configure
         the build system to generate a "compile_commands.json" file in the
         build directory. CMake will do this if called with
         "-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON".

                                                 *vim-bob:BobClean*
:BobClean
         Deletes `dev/build` and `dev/dist` directories to force rebuilding of
         all artifacts.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobGraph*
:BobGraph
         Generates dependency graph for the current project.
         Requires that |BobProject| has been called beforehand.
         |g:bob_graph_type| controls the output format.

==============================================================================

Configuration                                    *vim-bob-configuration*

g:bob_config_path
         Path to configuration files (with file extension ".yaml") relative to
         the base path.

g:bob_reduce_goto_list
         Default: 1
         The list of possible packages for |:BobGoto| is reduced to show only
         the leaf package instead of the complete tree from the project root
         package. As this could result in duplicates when different packages
         depend on the same package, these duplicate entries are removed as
         well. This is only performed if the source directory for all variants
         are equal, otherwise the variants will remain with their full package
         path.
         This reduces the number of elements and also their size
         significantly, which eases finding the correct one during command
         completion.
g:bob_graph_type
         Default: "d3"
         Output format of |BobGraph|, must be one of "d3" or "dot".

==============================================================================

Interaction with other plugins                   *vim-bob-interaction*

CtrlP
         Per default |CtrlP| will search the repository structure of the current
         file.
         In order to have all files of the current project (all files in `dev/`)
         available to the search it is necessary to set an additional root
         marker like "recipes", which should exist for sure.
         This is achived via `let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['recipes']` .
