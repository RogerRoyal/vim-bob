Commands                                         *vim-bob-commands*

                                                 *vim-bob:BobInit*
:BobInit
         Must be run before any other vim-bob command can be used. Initializes
         vim-bob with the current working directory as the base directory.
         The base directory is the directory where the bob commands are
         normally executed on the command line.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobCheckout*
:BobCheckout [package]
         Checkout the given [package].
         Runs "bob dev [package] --checkout-only".

                                                 *vim-bob:BobGoto*
:BobGoto [package]
         Changes the current working directory to be the source
         directory of the given [package].

                                                 *vim-bob:BobDev*
:BobDev [package] ([configuration] ([parameters]))
         Build [package] with [configuration] in development mode.
         Runs "bob dev [package] -c <configuration-dir>/[configuration]
         [parameters]"
         Additionally sets |makeprg| for the current file, so that
         subsequently the same command can be run via |:make| and error
         messages are parsed and gathered in the |quickfix| window.

                                                 *vim-bob:BobClean*
:BobClean
         Deletes `dev/build` and `dev/dist` directories to force rebuilding of
         all artifacts.
